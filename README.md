# 📘 SQL Practice Notebooks

Welcome to this interactive SQL learning repository! These Jupyter notebooks are designed as **slide-style lessons** with explanations, live SQL code, and small challenges for you to try.

You can run these notebooks directly in your browser — **no installation required** — using one of the two options below.
